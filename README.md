# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier for Iris Dataset

This Python script demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification on the Iris dataset. It covers basic machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Loading the Iris Dataset:**
   - Uses the popular Iris dataset from scikit-learn.

2. **Splitting the Dataset:**
   - Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classification:**
   - Initializes and trains a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluates the accuracy of the model on the test set.

5. **Confusion Matrix:**
   - Computes and displays a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

6. **Decision Boundaries Visualization:**
   - Plots the decision boundaries of the KNN classifier in a 2D feature space.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy
